This directory contains a script for verifying that eea.h
runs the estended Euclidean algorithm correctly. It does
so by running it alongside a python function which I have
tested thoroughly over the course of this semester (spring
2020). Run "run.sh" with two integer arguments. First the
eea.h function will be used, then the python script will run.
If the output is the same, then it works.

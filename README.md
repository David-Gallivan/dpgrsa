A C library to implement the RSA cryptosystem

Note on Apr 17:
First, Implement homemade modular exponentiation, p78-79
Next thing to do is make a random prime generator .h
Then I can go to straight to key generation

New note at the beginning of Apr 18:
I choose to skip homemade modexp for now.

Hey, yo, chicken on a raft!
